Hello, thanks for visiting my website! I'm Felix Opolka, an aspiring computer science researcher specialising in **machine learning**. Currently, I am a graduate student at the University of Cambridge studingy for an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science.

I was born and raised in Regensburg, a small town in Bavaria, Germany. After attending high school there, I moved to Munich to study Computer Science at the **Technical University of Munich** in 2015. During my undergraduate degree, I have developed a strong interest in machine learning and ended up doing research on using machine learning methods for drug discovery and later protein structure prediction in my final year.

After graduating in 2018, I enrolled in a master's degree at the **University of Cambridge** where I am continuing my research on machine learning methods.

In my free time, I enjoy writing and I headed my high school's student newspaper for many years as well as the student council's newspaper during my time in Munich. Besides that, I enjoy running, hiking, and skiing.
